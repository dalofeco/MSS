# Meeting Scheduling System (MSS)
A GUI based Java application that allows users to create their own meetings and organize them by assigning them to rooms and people. This was created as a project for CMPSC221 at Penn State Behrend for Proferssor Naseem Ibrahim.
## Usage
In order to try it, simply download the <b>MSS.jar</b> java executable under the <b>dist</b> directory and run it.
## Functionality
People can be created with first name, last name, and phone number.<br>
* A variable number of rooms can be created.<br>
* Meetings can be created with a combination of people to take place at a certain time in a specific room.<br>
* Meetings cannot overlap each other. (They cannot be in the same room at the same time or people cannot be in two places at once)<br>
* People and meetings can be edited.<br>
* All content can be saved onto a file for later re-loading back into the program.<br>
